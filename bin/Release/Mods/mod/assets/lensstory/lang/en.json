For a simple door using a Transposer and a Lever, Do the following: Step one: Using a Red Attuner, Shift click the air to set a frequency, this can be any combination of letters and numbers, make it yours! Then click 'confirm'. Step two: Shift click on the LEVER to set its OUTPUT frequency, then NORMALLY CLICK the TRANSPOSER to set its INPUT frequency. Step three: Pull the lever Kronk! For a more detailed explanation on what each part does, check its handbook page. Do note that while all parts technically have an input and output, doesn't mean they'll use it. There is no 'strength' for signals, only on or off. A channel does not care how many are on, if one is on, the signal is sent to all of that channels outputs.
